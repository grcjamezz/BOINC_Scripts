Warning:

The host.gz and user.gz files are huge. Several projects (such as SETI/WCG) host/user files are gigabytes in size. Importing them into mysql will take a significant quantity of time.

Import times could likely be sped up by running the mysql tables in memory and using more powerful hardware.
